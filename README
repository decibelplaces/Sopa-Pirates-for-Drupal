This module is a simple filter that, when enabled, will change your posts to 
"Pirate talk" everyday, not just on September 19th for Talk like a Pirate Day:
http://www.talklikeapirate.com/

The purpose is to show that your site supports the enemy of SOPA and PIPA, PIRATES!

forked by decibel.places from original module created by Richard Eriksson: http://drupal.org/project/pirate

Dougal Campbell (http://dougal.gunters.org/) for his word list (and similar Wordpress filter)
