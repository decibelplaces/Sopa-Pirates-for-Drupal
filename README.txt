This module is an input filter that will change posts containing "SOPA" or "PIPA" on your Drupal site to "Pirate talk"

The purpose is to show that your site's friend is the enemy of SOPA and PIPA: PIRATES!

forked by decibel.places from original D6 module created by Richard Eriksson: http://drupal.org/project/pirate
has not been tested in D7

Credits go to Richard Eriksson (http://www.richarderiksson.com/) and to 
Dougal Campbell (http://dougal.gunters.org/) for his word list (and similar Wordpress filter)
